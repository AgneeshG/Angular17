Okay, let's break down your answer for question 5, "What is one thing you are good at?"  You said, "I don't have any bad habits and I was everyone and I can easily mingle with agreement I think this is good at."
Here's how we can improve it:
 * "I don't have any bad habits" While this is a positive trait, it doesn't directly answer what you're good at.  It tells us something you aren't, not something you are.  We need to focus on a skill or talent.
 * "and I was everyone" This phrase is a little unclear.  Did you mean "I am with everyone" or perhaps "I get along with everyone"?
 * "and I can easily mingle with agreement I think this is good at"  This is also a bit unclear.  "Mingle" means to mix socially. "Agreement" suggests you're good at finding common ground or reaching consensus.  The phrase "I think this is good at" is grammatically incorrect.
Here are a few ways you could rephrase your answer to make it clearer and more grammatically correct:
 * Option 1 (Focusing on social skills): "I'm good at getting along with people and making them feel comfortable. I can easily mingle in social situations."
 * Option 2 (Focusing on finding agreement): "I'm good at finding common ground and helping people reach agreements. I'm a good mediator."
 * Option 3 (Combining ideas): "I'm a people person. I get along well with others and I'm good at finding solutions that everyone can agree on."
So, while the idea you were trying to express is positive (good social skills, ability to connect with others), the way you expressed it needs some work to be grammatically correct and clearly understood.  Choose one of the options above, or try to come up with your own based on these examples.  I'm happy to help you refine it further!



You're asking about other ways to answer "What is one thing you are good at?"  That's a great question!  The best answer depends on your actual skills and talents.  Here are some examples across different areas, categorized to give you ideas:

Practical/Technical:
 * "I'm good at fixing things. I'm quite handy around the house."



 * "I'm good at organizing and planning. I'm very detail-oriented."
Academic/Intellectual:

 * "I'm good at research. I enjoy digging into topics and finding information."
 * "I have a good memory. I can remember facts and details easily."
Social/Interpersonal:
 * "I'm a good listener. People often come to me for advice."
 * "I'm empathetic and compassionate. I care about others and try to help them."
 * "I'm a good team player. I work well with others and contribute to group projects."
 * "I'm a natural leader. I can motivate and inspire others."

Physical/Sports:
 * "I'm athletic. I play [sport] and I'm quite good at it."

 * "I'm good at yoga/pilates/other fitness activity."
Other/Unique:
 * "I'm a skilled debater. I enjoy arguing (respectfully) and presenting my point of view."



Key things to remember when answering:
 * Be specific: Instead of saying "I'm good at sports," say "I'm a good basketball player."
 * Give an example:  This makes your answer more convincing.  For example, "I'm good at cooking.  I recently made a [dish] that everyone loved."
 * Be honest:  Don't exaggerate your skills.
 * Be positive: Focus on your strengths.
So, think about your own skills and talents and choose an area where you feel confident.  Then, use the examples above as inspiration to craft your own specific and compelling answer.
